## Description
Single cell RNA-sequencing is a high-throughput approach to detect and perform cell population specific analysis using mRNA in biological samples to better understand differences in cell populations in cases and controls in study samples. A major field of inquiry in this omics-based approach is being able to filter and QC data for analysis, and being able to identify cell populations using marker genes for evaluation of transcriptomic based analysis of disease versus non-disease states. My role in project 4 was that of a biologist; therefore, here I explore the responsibilites of programmer and analyst for my final project in exploring single-cell RNA sequencing in pancreatic cells.

## Programmer
The Seurat pre-processing workflow is used to import and process the UMI count matrix generated above. Cells are grouped into subpopulations and low-quality readings are filtered.

## Analyst
Using the marker genes supplied in Baron et al's Supplementary Data, the cell subpopulations are categorized into separate cell types. Further, potential novel marker genes are detected.
